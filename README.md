# Flutter Command Line Project Generator ðŸš€

This Dart script is a simple command-line tool to generate a structured Flutter project with pre-configured dependencies and folder structures. It also allows adding new features to the existing project with a single command.

## Features

- **Project Initialization**: Automatically creates a new Flutter project structure with pre-defined directories and files.
- **Feature Addition**: Easily add new features to your existing project with necessary files and directories.
- **Dependency Management**: Adds essential dependencies to the `pubspec.yaml` file.

### Usage

Run the script with the following commands:

#### Initialize a new project

1. **Initialize a New Project:**

```sh
   fcsa init
    ```
2. **Adding a New Feature:**

```sh
   fcsa feature:<feature_name>
   ```

### Detailed Explanation of Structure

- **core/apis/**: Contains API endpoint definitions.
- **core/error/**: Contains custom exception classes.
- **core/network/**: Network-related classes, including services and interceptors.
- **core/storage/**: Secure storage service classes.
- **core/utils/**: Utility classes such as logger and string extensions.
- **core/bloc/**: Base BLoC classes for state management.
- **core/string_constants.dart**: String constants used across the app.
- **core/colors_constants.dart**: Color constants for the app.
- **core/asset_constants.dart**: Asset paths constants.
- **core/config.dart**: Configuration settings and environment variables.
- **features/**: Contains folders for different features of the app.
- **theme/**: Contains app theme definitions.
- **widgets/**: Common widgets used in the app.
- **service_locator.dart**: Service locator setup using `get_it`.
- **main.dart**: The entry point of the Flutter application.

### Dependencies Used

- `dio`: For handling HTTP requests.
- `flutter_secure_storage`: For secure data storage.
- `get_it`: For dependency injection.
- `flutter_bloc`: For state management.
- `equatable`: For simplifying equality comparisons in Dart objects.
- `adaptive_theme`: For adaptive theming support.

## Adding Dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`

The script automatically adds the following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` file if they are not already present:

```yaml
dependencies:
  dio: ^4.0.0
  flutter_secure_storage: ^5.0.2
  get_it: ^7.2.0
  flutter_bloc: ^7.3.3
  equatable: ^2.0.3
  adaptive_theme: ^3.6.0
```
